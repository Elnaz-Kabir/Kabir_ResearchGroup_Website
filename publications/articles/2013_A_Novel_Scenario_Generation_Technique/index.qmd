## Abstract

In this work, we propose a multi-product, single-period supply chain network design model under uncertainty. The main contribution is a hybrid scenario generation approach that combines **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)** with a **scenario reduction** method to efficiently generate representative scenarios for *uncertain, correlated customer demands*. The supply chain network includes plants, distribution centers, and customers, and the resulting mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation seeks to minimize total network cost while incorporating a customer satisfaction constraint.

## Keywords

Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP); Uncertainty; Stochastic programming; Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
