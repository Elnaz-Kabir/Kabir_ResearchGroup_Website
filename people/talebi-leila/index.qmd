## About

:::{#about}

Leila Talebi is a Ph.D. student here at Texas A&M Univeristy. She works on multiple aspects of energy-oriented supply chains, including spatio-temporal optimization under electricity price uncertainty, renewable energy integration, carbon pricing, and resilience analysis. Her research leverages operations research and data analysis to develop decision-support frameworks at the interface between industry and the power grid.

Outside of research, she enjoys cooking and going on long walks, which provide a relaxed counterbalance to her analytical work.
