## About

:::{#about}
Farah is a PhD student in power and energy systems, with a research focus on modeling AI-centric data center power demand and integrating AI agents for smarter grid and energy hub operation. Her work sits at the intersection of energy systems and intelligent decision-making, aiming to improve efficiency, reliability, and adaptability in modern power networks.

Outside of her research, she enjoy spending time outdoors through hiking, and likes working with her hands through crafting and beading, which gives her a creative balance to her technical work.
